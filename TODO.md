* auto-update on login?
** this is hacked in via .zlogin, not sure what would happen if the git pull wasn't successful
** testing! again!
* git config
* vimrc
* base configuration that can be appended to by profiles (hierarchy?)
** profile isn't read properly from config
** are profiles even needed?
* how can bootstrap.sh be improved?
** use conditional to pull instead of clone
* is there a need for push_ and pull_dotfiles?
